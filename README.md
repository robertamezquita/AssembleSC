<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AssembleSC is to create a package that automates the
assembly of single-cell RNA-seq data ingest, preprocessing, and some
basic analyses/visualizations, primarily drawing from the Bioconductor
universe of
packages.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of AssembleSC from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("AssembleSC") -->

<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of AssembleSC from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github('robertamezquita/AssembleSC')
```

## Workflow

### Ingest

`AssembleSC::ingest()` reads in results produced following alignment
using one of the following supported aligners:

  - STARsolo (modes: Gene, GeneFull)
  - kb-python (a wrapper for kallisto|bustools)

Future versions will aim to support velocity results a la LaManno et al.
(2019), as produced by STARsolo Velocyto or kb-python with the â€“lamanno
flag enabled. Support for basic kallisto output that produces
abundance.tsv files will also be supported in a future version.

The `AssembleSC::ingest()` function produces an annotated
`SingleCellExperiment` object.
